# EZChain Local Simulator

`ezc-sim` makes it easy for anyone to spin up a local instance of an EZChain network to interact with the [EZChain standard APIs](../ezcgo-apis/README.md) or to test a [custom VM](../tutorials/platform/subnets/create-custom-blockchain.md).

Detailed instructions can be found on the [github README](https://github.com/EZChain-core/ezc-sim#readme).

This tool is **NOT** intended to be a full-fledged node automation framework.
Rather, it is meant to be a simple tool for anyone to get started with
EZChain.

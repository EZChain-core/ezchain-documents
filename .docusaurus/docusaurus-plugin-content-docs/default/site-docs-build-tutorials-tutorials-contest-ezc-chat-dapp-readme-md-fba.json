  "description": "In this tutorial we will build a decentralized chat application on EZChain's Fuji test-network from scratch. The dApp will allow users to connect with other people and chat with them. We will develop our smart contract using Solidity which will be deployed on EZChain's C-chain. We will have a basic, easy-to-use UI developed using ReactJS. So, let us begin!",
